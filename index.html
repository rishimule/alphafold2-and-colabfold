          <h2>Introduction</h2>

          <p>AlphaFold2, developed by <a href="https://deepmind.google/">DeepMind</a> and described in the 2021 Nature
            paper "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold" by Jumper et al., uses deep learning
            with attention mechanisms and evolutionary sequence data to predict protein three-dimensional structures in
            minutes with near-experimental accuracy (median GDT > 90 in CASP14). It solves the protein folding problem,
            a grand challenge for over 50 years that resisted rapid, cost-effective solutions and forced reliance on
            slow, expensive, and sometimes unsuccessful experimental methods such as X-ray crystallography, NMR
            spectroscopy, and cryo-electron microscopy. This breakthrough enables rapid, reliable protein structure
            determination, transforming biological research and therapeutic development.</p>

          <p>Our team was inspired to delve deeper into this breakthrough to understand how AlphaFold2 works and explore
            its potential applications in research and education. After investigating implementation options, we
            discovered ColabFold - an adaptation of AlphaFold2 designed to run efficiently on Google Colab. This tool
            provides accessibility to this powerful technology without requiring specialized hardware, democratizing
            access to state-of-the-art protein structure prediction. Our project aims to demonstrate how ColabFold can
            be used to successfully predict protein structures and provide hands-on experience with a technology that's
            transforming structural biology worldwide.</p>

          <p>To assess the impact of evolutionary and template data on predictive performance, we will perform two
            contrasting ColabFold experiments. In the first, we will supply a deep MSA of ~150 homologs plus four
            high-quality structural templates to establish a high-information baseline. In the second, we will restrict
            the MSA to the query sequence alone and disable template use to simulate an information-poor scenario, then
            compare per-residue confidence (pLDDT) and overall pTM scores across multiple refinement cycles.</p>

          <h3>Why Is Protein Structure Important?</h3>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein">Proteins</a> are the molecular machines that carry out most
            cellular functions, from catalyzing biochemical
            reactions to providing structural support. Their function is intimately tied to their three-dimensional
            structure - the precise spatial arrangement of atoms that determines how a protein interacts with other
            molecules. Understanding protein structures is crucial for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level</li>
            <li>Rational drug design and development of therapeutics</li>
            <li>Engineering proteins with novel functions for biotechnology</li>
            <li>Deciphering biological processes and cellular machinery</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="image-container text-center">
            <figure class="mx-auto" style="width: 60%;">
              <img src="assets/images/protein_struct.png"
                alt="Protein folding process: from amino acid sequence to 3D protein structure" class="img-fluid shadow"
                style="border-radius: 8px;">
              <figcaption>Figure: The protein folding problem - how a linear chain of amino acids folds into a
                functional 3D structure.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>The classic paradigm "sequence determines structure determines function" highlights why predicting
            structure from amino acid sequence has been a grand challenge in molecular biology for over 50 years.</p>

          <h3>What are the Experimental Methods of Getting Protein Structure?</h3>
          <p>Traditional experimental methods for determining protein structures include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>X-ray Crystallography:</strong> The gold standard for high-resolution structures (often &lt;1.5Å
              resolution), but requires protein crystallization which can be difficult for many proteins</li>
            <li><strong>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:</strong> Works with proteins in solution but
              typically limited to smaller proteins (&lt;50kDa)</li>
            <li><strong>Cryo-electron Microscopy (cryo-EM):</strong> Recent advances allow near-atomic resolution,
              especially valuable for large complexes</li>
            <li><strong>Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS):</strong> Provides low-resolution shape information</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="image-container text-center">
            <figure class="mx-auto" style="width: 50%;">
              <img src="assets/images/experimental_methods.png"
                alt="Experimental methods for protein structure determination: X-Ray crystallography, NMR, and Cryo-EM"

                crystallography, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Cryoelectron microscopy.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>These methods are time-consuming (often taking months to years), expensive, and technically challenging,
            creating bottlenecks in structural biology research. This gap between known protein sequences (~200 million)
            and experimentally determined structures (~180,000) motivated computational prediction approaches.</p>

          <h3>What is CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction)?</h3>
          <p>CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is a biennial community-wide experiment established in
            1994 to objectively evaluate the state of the art in protein structure prediction. Key aspects include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Blind prediction format: participants predict structures of proteins whose experimental structures are
              determined but not yet published</li>
            <li>Standard metrics: primarily GDT_TS (Global Distance Test) and RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) to
              quantify prediction accuracy</li>
            <li>Diverse targets: ranging from easy comparative modeling cases to difficult free modeling scenarios</li>
            <li>Independent assessment: ensures unbiased evaluation of different methods</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="image-container text-center">
            <figure class="mx-auto" style="width: 50%;">
              <img src="assets/images/casp.png" alt="CASP Competition - Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction"

              <figcaption>Figure: The CASP competition, established in 1994, has been the gold standard benchmark for
                protein structure prediction for nearly three decades.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>CASP has been the gold standard benchmark for progress in the protein structure prediction field for nearly
            three decades, chronicling incremental advances until AlphaFold2's breakthrough.</p>

          <h3>How Did AlphaFold2 Revolutionize Prediction?</h3>
          <p>AlphaFold2 represented a paradigm shift in protein structure prediction through several key innovations:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>End-to-end differentiable architecture:</strong> Unlike previous approaches that combined
              disparate methods, AlphaFold2 integrated all components into a single neural network</li>
            <li><strong>Attention mechanisms:</strong> Leveraged transformer architectures to capture long-range
              dependencies and evolutionary patterns between residues</li>
            <li><strong>Structure module:</strong> Directly predicted 3D coordinates through iterative refinement rather
              than assembling fragments</li>
            <li><strong>Evolutionary information:</strong> Effectively leveraged multiple sequence alignments to extract
              co-evolutionary signals</li>
            <li><strong>Self-confidence scoring:</strong> Developed pLDDT metric to assess prediction quality without
              ground truth</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="image-container text-center">
            <figure class="mx-auto" style="width: 70%;">
              <img src="assets/images/casp_gdt_scores_Alphafold2_broke_record_in_2020.jpg"
                alt="Chart showing dramatic improvement in CASP scores with AlphaFold2 in 2020" class="img-fluid shadow"
                style="border-radius: 8px;">
              <figcaption>Figure: The unprecedented leap in prediction accuracy achieved by AlphaFold2 in CASP14 (2020),

            </figure>
          </div>

          <p>The result was a system that achieved unprecedented accuracy in CASP14 (2020), with a median GDT_TS of 92.4
            for all targets and even achieving competitive results for the most difficult free modeling cases. This
            performance approaches experimental accuracy, effectively solving a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology.

          <h3>Team at AlphaFold</h3>
          <p>The AlphaFold breakthrough came from DeepMind, a London-based AI company (acquired by Google in 2014). The
            interdisciplinary team combined expertise from machine learning, structural biology, physics, and
            bioinformatics:</p>

          <h2>AlphaFold2 Architecture: A Deep Dive</h2>

          <p>The AlphaFold2 architecture represents a revolutionary approach to protein structure prediction, combining
            evolutionary information with deep learning to achieve unprecedented accuracy. Unlike previous methods that
            relied on fragment assembly and physics-based simulations, AlphaFold2 uses an end-to-end neural network
            approach to directly predict 3D coordinates.</p>

            </figure>
          </div>

          <h3>Key Components</h3>

          <h4>1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Processing</h4>
          <p>The first critical component of AlphaFold2 is the processing of evolutionary information through multiple
            sequence alignments:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Searches genetic databases to find evolutionarily related sequences</li>
            <li>Aligns these sequences to capture conservation patterns</li>
            <li>Generates a rich representation that captures which amino acids tend to co-evolve</li>
            <li>This evolutionary information is crucial, as co-evolving residues often indicate spatial proximity in
              the folded structure</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>2. Template Processing</h4>
          <p>While not always necessary for accurate predictions, AlphaFold2 can use information from known protein
            structures:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Searches structural databases (PDB) for proteins with similar sequences</li>
            <li>Extracts distance maps and structural features from these templates</li>
            <li>Integrates this information with sequence-based predictions</li>
            <li>This component helps guide the model, especially for proteins with known homologs</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>3. Evoformer</h4>
          <p>The core of AlphaFold2's architecture is the Evoformer, a novel transformer-based neural network:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Contains 48 identical blocks that iteratively refine representations</li>
            <li>Processes both MSA and pairwise representations simultaneously</li>
            <li>Uses specialized attention mechanisms to update information bidirectionally between these
              representations</li>
            <li>Key mechanisms include:
              <ul>
                <li>Row-wise gated self-attention: processes evolutionary information across sequence positions</li>
                <li>Column-wise gated self-attention: processes evolutionary information across aligned sequences</li>
                <li>Triangle multiplication: models higher-order interactions between residues</li>
                <li>Transition layers: non-linear processing that integrates information</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>The final stage of AlphaFold2 is the Structure Module, which converts refined representations into 3D

          <ul>

            <li>Takes the representations from the Evoformer and gradually builds the 3D structure</li>

            </li>
            <li>Predicts backbone frames (rotations and translations)</li>
            <li>Computes atom positions based on these frames</li>

          <h4>5. Recycling and Confidence Estimation</h4>
          <p>AlphaFold2 employs two additional techniques that significantly improve its performance:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Recycling:</strong> The entire prediction process is repeated multiple times (typically 3), with
              each iteration using the output of the previous one as input. This allows the model to refine its
              predictions based on emerging structural information.</li>
            <li><strong>Confidence Estimation:</strong> AlphaFold2 provides two key metrics:
              <ul>
                <li>pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test): per-residue confidence scores from 0-100, with
                  higher values indicating greater confidence</li>
                <li>PAE (Predicted Aligned Error): estimates the expected position error between any two residues,
                  providing insight into the reliability of domain arrangements in multi-domain proteins</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>This sophisticated architecture enables AlphaFold2 to achieve remarkable accuracy, with many predictions
            reaching experimental-level quality (GDT scores > 90). The integration of evolutionary information with
            geometric reasoning through deep learning represents a fundamental breakthrough in protein structure
            prediction.</p>

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>Our approach utilizes ColabFold, an open-source adaptation of AlphaFold2 designed for accessibility and
            efficiency. Developed by Mirdita et al., ColabFold significantly reduces the computational barriers to
            protein structure prediction while maintaining AlphaFold2's accuracy. Key advantages of ColabFold include:
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Accelerated MSA generation using MMseqs2, reducing search times from hours to minutes</li>
            <li>Optimized implementation for Google Colab's free GPU resources</li>
            <li>Streamlined preprocessing and reduced memory requirements</li>
            <li>Support for both protein monomer and complex predictions</li>
            <li>Interactive visualization tools for structural analysis</li>
            <li>Batch processing capabilities for multiple sequences</li>
          </ul>

          <p>ColabFold preserves the core AlphaFold2 architecture while making it accessible to researchers without
            specialized computing infrastructure. Our implementation follows the standard ColabFold pipeline, which
            employs a multi-stage neural network architecture consisting of:</p>

          <ol>
            <li>Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) generation using MMseqs2 to capture evolutionary information</li>
            <li>Template structure identification from the PDB database</li>
            <li>Neural network processing through the Evoformer (48 blocks) which refines sequence representations</li>
            <li>Structure module (8 blocks) that predicts backbone coordinates and side chain orientations</li>
            <li>Confidence assessment using pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) scores</li>
          </ol>

          <p>For our experiments, we configured ColabFold with the following parameters:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Model type: "auto" (automatically selects appropriate model based on input)</li>
            <li>MSA depth: 512 sequences</li>
            <li>Extra MSA depth: 1024 sequences</li>
            <li>Number of recycles: 6</li>
            <li>Early stopping tolerance: 0.5 RMSD</li>
            <li>Use of templates: Enabled with PDB70 database</li>
          </ul>

          <p>We focused on lysozyme as our test protein, which showed very high confidence scores (pLDDT ~0.98) and
            compared it with experimentally determined structures (PDB ID: 1LYZ). The entire prediction process, from
            sequence input to final structure, took approximately 1-2 minutes on a T4 GPU, highlighting the efficiency
            of the ColabFold implementation.</p>

          <p>The high confidence score (blue coloring in pLDDT visualization) indicates a highly reliable prediction
            across the entire protein structure, demonstrating AlphaFold2's remarkable ability to predict protein
            structures with near-experimental accuracy.</p>


          <h3>Experiment 2: Exploring the Limitations of AlphaFold2</h3>
          <p>To understand the boundaries of AlphaFold2's capabilities, we conducted two challenging prediction
            scenarios:</p>
          <h4>Scenario A: Limited Evolutionary Information (Lysozyme)</h4>
          <p>We tested how the prediction quality changes for a significantly larger protein fragment( ~1000 amino
            acids) under
            challenging conditions when evolutionary information is restricted:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduced MSA depth from 512 to just 2 sequences</li>
            <li>Maintained all other parameters</li>
            <li>No structural templates available</li>
            <li>Observed significant degradation in prediction quality:
              <ul>
                <li>pLDDT scores dropped from 0.984 to 0.433 at best</li>
                <li>Required full 6 recycles (no early stopping)</li>
                <li>High predicted alignment errors (predominantly red PAE matrix)</li>
                <li>Unstable structures across recycles with large RMSD variations</li>
                <li>Different models produced substantially different predicted structures</li>
              </ul>
            </li>

          <h3>Key Insights from Experiments</h3>
          <p>These experiments collectively demonstrate that AlphaFold2's prediction quality depends on multiple
            interdependent factors:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Evolutionary information (MSA depth) plays a crucial role in achieving high-confidence predictions</li>
            <li>Template availability provides important structural guidance</li>
            <li>Prediction quality degrades substantially under challenging conditions with limited information</li>
            <li>The combination of protein complexity and limited evolutionary information presents the greatest
              challenge</li>
            <li>Under optimal conditions, predictions can achieve near-experimental accuracy</li>
          </ul>

        <section id="conclusion">
          <h3>Conclusion:</h3>
          <p>Our hands-on exploration of AlphaFold2 through ColabFold has revealed both the impressive capabilities and
            important limitations of this revolutionary technology. While we achieved remarkable accuracy with lysozyme
            prediction (pLDDT scores of 0.984), our experiments with challenging scenarios demonstrated clear
            performance boundaries. When working with a protein fragment under constrained conditions (minimal MSA depth
            and no templates), prediction confidence dropped significantly, with pLDDT scores averaging only around
            30-50% and high predicted alignment errors as visualized in the red confidence maps.</p>

          <p>These findings highlight a crucial insight about the interdependent factors affecting prediction quality:
            the absence of sufficient evolutionary information (limited MSA) combined with lack of structural templates
            dramatically impacts performance, especially for challenging proteins. Our experimental comparison
            demonstrates how AlphaFold2's success depends on the integration of multiple data sources rather than any
            single algorithmic innovation. This Nobel Prize-worthy breakthrough represents a sophisticated synthesis of
            evolutionary information, structural knowledge, and deep learning rather than a complete departure from
            traditional approaches.</p>
