    <h2>Related Work</h2>
    <p>AlphaFold2 builds upon decades of protein structure prediction research, dramatically improving upon previous methods. The seminal paper by Jumper et al. (2021) titled "Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold" published in Nature revolutionized the field by achieving unprecedented accuracy in CASP14 <cite><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></cite>. Our work directly builds on ColabFold by Mirdita et al. (2022), which made AlphaFold more accessible through Google Colab implementation <cite><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></cite>. Unlike previous approaches that relied on fragment assembly and physics-based refinement, AlphaFold2 uses attention-based deep learning to directly predict 3D coordinates. Our implementation explores practical applications of these methods for educational purposes.</p>
    
    <h3>Why Is Protein Structure Important?</h3>
    <p>Proteins are the molecular machines that carry out most cellular functions, from catalyzing biochemical reactions to providing structural support. Their function is intimately tied to their three-dimensional structure - the precise spatial arrangement of atoms that determines how a protein interacts with other molecules. Understanding protein structures is crucial for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Understanding disease mechanisms at the molecular level</li>
      <li>Rational drug design and development of therapeutics</li>
      <li>Engineering proteins with novel functions for biotechnology</li>
      <li>Deciphering biological processes and cellular machinery</li>
    </ul>

        <img src="assets/images/protein_struct.png" alt="Protein folding process: from amino acid sequence to 3D protein structure" class="img-fluid shadow" style="border-radius: 8px;">
        <figcaption>Figure: The protein folding problem - how a linear chain of amino acids folds into a functional 3D structure.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    
    <p>The classic paradigm "sequence determines structure determines function" highlights why predicting structure from amino acid sequence has been a grand challenge in molecular biology for over 50 years.</p>
    
    <h3>What are the Experimental Methods of Getting Protein Structure?</h3>
    <p>Traditional experimental methods for determining protein structures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>X-ray Crystallography:</strong> The gold standard for high-resolution structures (often &lt;1.5Å resolution), but requires protein crystallization which can be difficult for many proteins</li>
      <li><strong>Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) Spectroscopy:</strong> Works with proteins in solution but typically limited to smaller proteins (&lt;50kDa)</li>
      <li><strong>Cryo-electron Microscopy (cryo-EM):</strong> Recent advances allow near-atomic resolution, especially valuable for large complexes</li>
      <li><strong>Small-angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS):</strong> Provides low-resolution shape information</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container text-center">
      <figure class="mx-auto" style="width: 50%;">
        <img src="assets/images/experimental_methods.png" alt="Experimental methods for protein structure determination: X-Ray crystallography, NMR, and Cryo-EM" class="img-fluid shadow" style="border-radius: 8px;">
        <figcaption>Figure: Major experimental techniques for protein structure determination: X-Ray crystallography, Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and Cryoelectron microscopy.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    
    <p>These methods are time-consuming (often taking months to years), expensive, and technically challenging, creating bottlenecks in structural biology research. This gap between known protein sequences (~200 million) and experimentally determined structures (~180,000) motivated computational prediction approaches.</p>
    
    <h3>What is CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction)?</h3>
    <p>CASP (Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction) is a biennial community-wide experiment established in 1994 to objectively evaluate the state of the art in protein structure prediction. Key aspects include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Blind prediction format: participants predict structures of proteins whose experimental structures are determined but not yet published</li>
      <li>Standard metrics: primarily GDT_TS (Global Distance Test) and RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) to quantify prediction accuracy</li>
      <li>Diverse targets: ranging from easy comparative modeling cases to difficult free modeling scenarios</li>
      <li>Independent assessment: ensures unbiased evaluation of different methods</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container text-center">
      <figure class="mx-auto" style="width: 50%;">
        <img src="assets/images/casp.png" alt="CASP Competition - Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction" class="img-fluid shadow" style="border-radius: 8px;">
        <figcaption>Figure: The CASP competition, established in 1994, has been the gold standard benchmark for protein structure prediction for nearly three decades.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    
    <p>CASP has been the gold standard benchmark for progress in the protein structure prediction field for nearly three decades, chronicling incremental advances until AlphaFold2's breakthrough.</p>
    
    <h3>How Did AlphaFold2 Revolutionize Prediction?</h3>
    <p>AlphaFold2 represented a paradigm shift in protein structure prediction through several key innovations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>End-to-end differentiable architecture:</strong> Unlike previous approaches that combined disparate methods, AlphaFold2 integrated all components into a single neural network</li>
      <li><strong>Attention mechanisms:</strong> Leveraged transformer architectures to capture long-range dependencies and evolutionary patterns between residues</li>
      <li><strong>Structure module:</strong> Directly predicted 3D coordinates through iterative refinement rather than assembling fragments</li>
      <li><strong>Evolutionary information:</strong> Effectively leveraged multiple sequence alignments to extract co-evolutionary signals</li>
      <li><strong>Self-confidence scoring:</strong> Developed pLDDT metric to assess prediction quality without ground truth</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container text-center">
      <figure class="mx-auto" style="width: 70%;">
        <img src="assets/images/casp_gdt_scores_Alphafold2_broke_record_in_2020.jpg" alt="Chart showing dramatic improvement in CASP scores with AlphaFold2 in 2020" class="img-fluid shadow" style="border-radius: 8px;">
        <figcaption>Figure: The unprecedented leap in prediction accuracy achieved by AlphaFold2 in CASP14 (2020), showing median GDT scores across CASP competitions from 2006 to 2020.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    
    <p>The result was a system that achieved unprecedented accuracy in CASP14 (2020), with a median GDT_TS of 92.4 for all targets and even achieving competitive results for the most difficult free modeling cases. This performance approaches experimental accuracy, effectively solving a 50-year-old grand challenge in biology.</p>
    
    <h3>Team at AlphaFold</h3>
    <p>The AlphaFold breakthrough came from DeepMind, a London-based AI company (acquired by Google in 2014). The interdisciplinary team combined expertise from machine learning, structural biology, physics, and bioinformatics:</p>

    <h2>AlphaFold2 Architecture: A Deep Dive</h2>
    
    <p>The AlphaFold2 architecture represents a revolutionary approach to protein structure prediction, combining evolutionary information with deep learning to achieve unprecedented accuracy. Unlike previous methods that relied on fragment assembly and physics-based simulations, AlphaFold2 uses an end-to-end neural network approach to directly predict 3D coordinates.</p>
    
    <div class="image-container">

        <figcaption>Figure: Overall architecture of AlphaFold2 showing the complete pipeline from amino acid sequence to 3D structure prediction.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Key Components</h3>
    
    <h4>1. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) Processing</h4>
    <p>The first critical component of AlphaFold2 is the processing of evolutionary information through multiple sequence alignments:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Searches genetic databases to find evolutionarily related sequences</li>
      <li>Aligns these sequences to capture conservation patterns</li>
      <li>Generates a rich representation that captures which amino acids tend to co-evolve</li>
      <li>This evolutionary information is crucial, as co-evolving residues often indicate spatial proximity in the folded structure</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Template Processing</h4>
    <p>While not always necessary for accurate predictions, AlphaFold2 can use information from known protein structures:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Searches structural databases (PDB) for proteins with similar sequences</li>
      <li>Extracts distance maps and structural features from these templates</li>
      <li>Integrates this information with sequence-based predictions</li>
      <li>This component helps guide the model, especially for proteins with known homologs</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>3. Evoformer</h4>
    <p>The core of AlphaFold2's architecture is the Evoformer, a novel transformer-based neural network:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Contains 48 identical blocks that iteratively refine representations</li>
      <li>Processes both MSA and pairwise representations simultaneously</li>
      <li>Uses specialized attention mechanisms to update information bidirectionally between these representations</li>
      <li>Key mechanisms include:
        <ul>
          <li>Row-wise gated self-attention: processes evolutionary information across sequence positions</li>
          <li>Column-wise gated self-attention: processes evolutionary information across aligned sequences</li>
          <li>Triangle multiplication: models higher-order interactions between residues</li>
          <li>Transition layers: non-linear processing that integrates information</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="image-container">

        <figcaption>Figure 3: Detailed structure of the Evoformer module showing the various attention mechanisms and information flow.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    
    <h4>4. Structure Module</h4>
    <p>The final stage of AlphaFold2 is the Structure Module, which converts refined representations into 3D coordinates:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Consists of 8 blocks with shared weights</li>
      <li>Takes the representations from the Evoformer and gradually builds the 3D structure</li>
      <li>Uses Invariant Point Attention (IPA): a novel attention mechanism that respects the physics of 3D space</li>
      <li>Predicts backbone frames (rotations and translations)</li>
      <li>Computes atom positions based on these frames</li>
      <li>Predicts torsion angles (χ angles) to determine side chain conformations</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="image-container">

        <figcaption>Figure: Detailed structure of the Structure module showing the various attention mechanisms and information flow.</figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>
    
    <h4>5. Recycling and Confidence Estimation</h4>
    <p>AlphaFold2 employs two additional techniques that significantly improve its performance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Recycling:</strong> The entire prediction process is repeated multiple times (typically 3), with each iteration using the output of the previous one as input. This allows the model to refine its predictions based on emerging structural information.</li>
      <li><strong>Confidence Estimation:</strong> AlphaFold2 provides two key metrics:
        <ul>
          <li>pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test): per-residue confidence scores from 0-100, with higher values indicating greater confidence</li>
          <li>PAE (Predicted Aligned Error): estimates the expected position error between any two residues, providing insight into the reliability of domain arrangements in multi-domain proteins</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This sophisticated architecture enables AlphaFold2 to achieve remarkable accuracy, with many predictions reaching experimental-level quality (GDT scores > 90). The integration of evolutionary information with geometric reasoning through deep learning represents a fundamental breakthrough in protein structure prediction.</p>

  <section id="methods">
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>Our approach utilizes ColabFold, an open-source adaptation of AlphaFold2 designed for accessibility. The method employs a multi-stage neural network architecture consisting of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) generation using MMseqs2 to capture evolutionary information</li>
      <li>Template structure identification from the PDB database</li>
      <li>Neural network processing through the Evoformer (48 blocks) which refines sequence representations</li>
      <li>Structure module (8 blocks) that predicts backbone coordinates and side chain orientations</li>
      <li>Confidence assessment using pLDDT (predicted Local Distance Difference Test) scores</li>
    </ol>
    <p>We focused on lysozyme as our test protein, which showed very high confidence scores (pLDDT ~0.98) and compared it with experimentally determined structures (PDB ID: 1LYZ).</p>

  <section id="discussion">
    <h2>Discussion</h2>
    <p>Our exploration of AlphaFold2 and ColabFold highlights the transformative impact of deep learning on structural biology. The ability to predict protein structures with such high accuracy in minutes rather than months of laboratory work represents a paradigm shift in the field. Beyond technical achievements, several questions emerge:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>How will this technology democratize structural biology research globally?</li>
      <li>What impact will rapidly available protein structures have on drug discovery and personalized medicine?</li>
      <li>How might prediction of challenging structures (membrane proteins, large complexes, intrinsically disordered regions) improve in future iterations?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>While AlphaFold2 represents a monumental achievement, challenges remain in predicting protein-small molecule interactions, dynamic conformational changes, and structure prediction with limited sequence data. Our work demonstrates the educational value of making these cutting-edge tools accessible to students and researchers with limited computational resources.</p>
